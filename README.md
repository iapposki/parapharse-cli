# Paraphrase CLI App

- To setup app, execute `npm install` and `npm install -g` respectively. This should setup the phrase `opcli` as the command.
- For help, execute `opcli <command> --help`.
- To make the app paraphrase a prompt, execute `opcli paraphrase --type <urgent/professional/creative> --prompt <sentence to be paraphrased>` without the angular brackets.
